This is the backend core for an advanced Identity and Access Management (IAM) platform. It handles:

*   👤 **User & Organization Management**: Multi-tenant support for isolating users and data by organization.
*   🔐 **Authentication**: Secure email/password login, JWT (Access & Refresh tokens), and SSO (OAuth2, LDAP, SAML placeholders).
*   ⚖️ **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Fine-grained control with roles, permissions, and role hierarchy.
*   📜 **Audit Trail**: Detailed logging of all significant actions for security and compliance.
*   🗃️ **Database Integration**: Built on SQLAlchemy with PostgreSQL support and includes database migrations with Flask-Migrate.
*   ⚡ **Flask Performance**: A production-ready, scalable Python backend.
